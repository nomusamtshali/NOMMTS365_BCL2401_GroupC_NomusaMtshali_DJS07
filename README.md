# DJS07 - Build a Meme Generator

# Project Brief

- In this challenge/project, I was required to code-along the Scrimba lesson: [(https://scrimba.com/playlist/prXJpCQ)]

# Project Overview

- This starter repo only has CSS styling added to the empty React project.
- After cloning run npm install to install dependencies.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- Understanding React Fundamentals - I managed to create React components.
- Building User Interfaces - I gained experience in building an interactive UI with React. I used JSX to define the structure and styling of the meme generator and handling events (e.g., button clicks) to update the UI

## Challenges Faced

- Understanding React Concepts - Concepts like components, props, and state management might be challenging to grasp.
- Managing Component State - The meme generator involved managing the state of the component to store the entered captions. This was tricky.
- State Management - While the Scrimba lesson might have used a simple state management solution, keeping track of meme image selection, captions, and other dynamic elements were a challenge.
- Fetching API.

## Areas of Improvement

- Improving Code Structure - As I learn more about React best practices, I will revisit the code and improve its organization, readability, and maintainability.
- State Management.
- Managing Component State.

# Overall Learning Experience

- Building a meme generator with React was a great way to learn the fundamentals of web development with React. I learned, the power of component-based development, how to create interactive UIs with React, the basics of handling user input and state management and the importance of building user-friendly interfaces. I look forward to using React in my future projects.
